# South_African_Language_Identification

##Project Description

Welcome to our project! Language is a powerful tool that can be used to strengthen democracy and promote social, cultural, intellectual, economic, and political development in South Africa.

This project aims to develop a language identification system that can accurately identify the language of any given text input, using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze text features and determine the most likely language.

South Africa is a multilingual country with 11 official languages, each with equal status. Most South Africans are multilingual, speaking at least two or more official languages.

Given the multilingual population, it is important for our systems and devices to also communicate in multiple languages. This project will develop a system that can identify the language of any text input in any of South Africa's 11 official languages.

In other words, we are developing a system that can tell you which language a piece of text is written in, even if the text is in a language that you do not understand. For example, if you have a piece of text in isiZulu and you do not speak isiZulu, you can use our system to identify the language of the text.
